## Introduction

*Quarto* is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. It aims at making knowledge sharing more dynamic, more accessible and more reproducible through a complete workflow and best practices. My aim is to use *Quarto* as an orchestration tool for knowledge repos. This website can act as a starting template for documenting projects in various area of interests.
